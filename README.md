# Termux-Dwybneed
Termux - Download what you basically need
-----------------------------------------
This python file was basically made because it was 
annoying to manually download the necessary files one by one.

How to use:
-----------------------------------------
cd Termux-Dwybneed
python Dwybneed-install.py 
(Since pkg update and pkg upgrade are done 
automatically, it is okay not to do so.)
Run it and everything you need will be downloaded.
"CAUTION" You MUST run from $HOME!
